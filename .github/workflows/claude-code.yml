            Review this PR by examining the diff carefully. For each issue you find:

            1. Use the GitHub inline comment tool to add comments directly on the specific lines of code that have issues
            2. Include code suggestions using GitHub's suggestion syntax when appropriate:
               ```suggestion
               // corrected code here
               ```

            Focus on:
            - Bugs and logic errors
            - Security vulnerabilities
            - Performance issues
            - Code quality problems

            Be concise. Only comment on significant issues, not style nitpicks.
            After adding inline comments, provide a brief summary of your review.
